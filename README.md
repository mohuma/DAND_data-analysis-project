### Date created
Investigate a dataset project in Python/Jupyter was created on 26-Sep-2021.

### Project Title
**Closing the gap in world health and economics -
a data analysis project to convey the fact-based worldview**

### Description
In this data analysis project, I intend to convey fact-based view about the
world health and economics. Specifically, I have used data from Gapminder.org to
attempt to answer the following two questions:

**How does the income inequality across countries affect people's life expectancy
and child mortality rate in their communities?**

**Has the income inequality across countries worsened or gotten better in the last
60 years? What impact did this change have on life expectancy and child
mortality rate?**

### Files used
To aid in my analysis, I downloaded the following four datasets in .csv format
from Gapminder.org:

GDP per capita - This dataset contains income per person (GDP per person adjusted
    for inflation and converted to international dollars using purchasing power
    parity), GDP total and GDP per capita growth % listed by country name for
    every year since 1800.

Child mortality - This dataset contains child mortality rate (death of children
    under five year of age per 1000 live birth) listed by country name for every
    year since 1800.

Life expectancy - This dataset contains life expectancy rate (the average number
    of years a newborn child would live if the current mortality patterns were
    to remain the same) listed by country name for every year since 1800.

Population - This dataset contains total population listed by country name for
    every year since 1800.

### Credits
The data was downloaded from [Gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org/) free of charge.
